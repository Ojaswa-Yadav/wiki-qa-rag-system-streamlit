# Wiki QA RAG System

This project implements a Question Answering (QA) system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the Wiki QA dataset. It provides an interactive interface built with Streamlit for exploring the dataset, asking questions, and evaluating the system's performance.

## Features

- Semantic search using SBERT (Sentence-BERT) embeddings
- Question answering using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model
- Answer generation using a T5-based language model
- Interactive exploration of the Wiki QA dataset
- System evaluation with ROUGE and BLEU scores
- Model fine-tuning capabilities
